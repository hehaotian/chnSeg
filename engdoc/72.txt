Botulism

What is Botulism and how do people get it?

   Botulism is a serious illness that causes paralysis or muscle
   weakness, including weakness in muscles needed for breathing. It is
   caused by a poisonous nerve toxin released by bacteria named
   Clostridium botulinum.


   Most of the time, botulism bacteria live in an inactive form called
   spores. Inactive botulism spores are found widely in soil, dust, and
   honey. A hard coating helps the spores survive heat, drying, and
   radiation for long periods of time. When botulism spores enter the
   human body, they turn into active botulism bacteria and begin making
   botulism nerve toxin. Botulism toxin can also be present in foods that
   are not properly canned or refrigerated.


   Botulism is not a common illness but it does occur naturally. In
   2004-2005 there 11 cases of botulism in San Francisco.
   Naturally-occurring botulism can occur when:
     * An infant under 12 months old swallows raw honey or corn syrum
       contaminated with botulism spores (infant botulism). Raw honey and
       corn syrup are not a danger to older children or adults, just to
       infants.
     * Someone injects heroin that has been contaminated with botulism
       spores (wound botulism). "Black tar" heroin is most frequently
       associated with wound botulism.
     * A person eats food containing botulism toxin (food-borne
       botulism).


   Terrorists could use botulism to hurt people on purpose by releasing
   botulism toxin in public places. This would cause people to breathe in
   the toxin or to swallow it after it gets on their hands or their food.


What if there is a Botulism Emergency in San Francisco?

   The San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH) has a plan to
   respond quickly to a botulism emergency. SFDPH will evaluate the
   botulism situation and may recommend ways for people to keep
   themselves and their family safe. SFDPH will also participate in
   efforts to provide needed medical support and treatment, and to reduce
   any ongoing sources of botulism toxin.

How can I keep from getting Botulism?

   To lower your risk of getting botulism from a natural source:
     * Store food at the correct temperature. For example, refrigerate
       food at all times if the package says "Refrigerate" or
       "Perishable" or if it was refrigerated at the store. Potatoes
       baked in aluminum foil must either be kept hot or refrigerated.
     * Discard foods after the expiration date or if a food can is
       swollen, rusty, or damaged.
     * Follow strict hygienic procedures when you do home canning. Boil
       home-canned foods for 10 minutes before eating.
     * Do not give infants younger than 12 months honey, corn syrup, or
       undercooked foods.
     * Never inject street drugs, especially black tar heroin. It is not
       possible to prevent wound botulism by cooking or cleaning the
       dope. If you must inject, use new sterile syringes for each
       injection. If you must reuse, clean syringes with bleach. Before
       injecting, thoroughly clean the injection site with soap and hot
       water or with alcohol swabs. Never share needles, syringes, or
       works.


   To lower your risk of getting sick if terrorists release botulism
   toxin on purpose:
     * If you were exposed to a suspicious substance or if you were in an
       area thought to contain botulism toxin, it may help to wash your
       skin and hair thoroughly with soap and water. It may also help to
       change and wash your clothing, or if you cannot wash your clothes
       immediately, to put them in a plastic bag to keep them separate
       from your other things.

Can Medicine or a Vaccine (shot) Prevent Botulism?

   No. There is no medicine to prevent botulism. There is an
   investigational vaccine that is available only to laboratory people
   working with Clostridium botulinum or the toxin.

Can I catch botulism from Someone?

   No. Botulism is not contagious (not spread from person to person).

What are the Signs of Botulism?

   The signs of botulism disease are:
     * Drooping eyelids, seeing double, or blurry vision
     * Dry mouth, slurred speech, or trouble talking
     * Trouble breathing
     * Muscle weakness or paralysis
     * Severe constipation

   After swallowing, touching, or breathing in botulism toxin, illness
   usually starts within 12-72 hours.  After swallowing or injecting
   botulism spores, it takes 4 to 14 days until the first signs of
   illness.


   See a doctor right away if you are having the signs listed above and
   you think you may have been exposed to botulism. It is important to
   start medical treatment as soon as possible.

Is there Treatment for Botulism?

   Medical treatment is available for people who are sick with botulism.
   Treatment may include a medicine (antitoxin) and a breathing machine
   (ventilator). Wound botulism may require cleaning and removal of
   wounds or abscesses. A breathing machine may be needed when botulism
   weakens the muscles needed for breathing or stops them from working
   altogether. Antitoxin medicine can inactivate botulism toxin, but it
   does not cure the disease immediately. Paralysis may take weeks or
   months to wear off. The supply of the antitoxin medicine may be
   limited in an emergency situation.


How can I find Information during a Botulism Emergency?

   Check the SFDPH website [107]www.sfdph.org/cdcp. Local media such as
   newspapers, TV stations and radio will carry emergency instructions.
   Emergency radio stations include: KCBS 740 AM and KGO 810 AM.


What can I do Now if I am worried about Botulism?

     * Read about botulism at [108]www.sfdph.org/cdcp and at the CDC page
       [109]www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/botulism
     * Go to [110]www.72hours.org to learn about steps you can take now
       to prepare for all disasters.
     * Keep a card in your wallet with a list of your health problems,
       the names and doses of medicines you take, and any medications you
       are allergic to.
