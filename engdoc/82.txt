needles and “works.” 
• If you prefer, The New York City Department
of Health and Mental Hygiene can tell your
partners. They will be told without ever
using your name or revealing your  identity.

It’s hard to hear you’re HIV-positive.
There’s a  lot to think about and a  lot of
feelings to deal with, but remember, it’s
better to know than not to know.
When you get the care you need, you 
can  live a  longer, healthier  life.

HELP IS AVAILABLE
There are many good doctors who treat patients
with HIV. Good medical care helps you stay
healthy and  live  free of AIDS or other HIV-
related problems.
If you are pregnant, it  is especially  important to
see an HIV doctor. You can take medicine to
help yourself and greatly reduce the chance of
giving HIV to your baby.

TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF
• Get good medical care.
• Get help  for depression, drinking, and/or
other drugs.

• Use a male  latex
condom (or a
female condom)
for every sexual
act.
• Talk to trusted
family and
friends—their
support will 
help you.

WHAT ABOUT SEX?
You can pass HIV to others during sex through
your blood, semen, or vaginal  fluids. Having sex
can also expose you to other STDs and other
strains of HIV.

If You Choose To Have Sex:
• Always use a male latex condom or a female
condom whenever you have sex—vaginal,
anal, or oral.
If you are allergic to  latex, use
condoms (including  female condoms) made of
polyurethane or other synthetic mater ials .
• DON’T use condoms made of “natural”
materials, like lambskin—these only prevent
pregnancy, NOT HIV and other STDs.
• Limit the number of people you have sex with.
• Don’t drink and/or take drugs when
you have sex.
• Get tested and treated  for STDs.

But Also Remember:
• Do not share your toothbrush or razor.
• Do not share needles used to  inject 
vitamins, or  for piercing or tattooing.
• It  is possible to transmit HIV through breast
milk.Talk to your doctor before breastfeeding.
HIV  is not spread by casual contact or by saliva,
tears, urine, or sweat.
