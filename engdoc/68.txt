ASTER QUICK TIPS:  Basic Food Safety 
 
 
Do not eat unsafe food 
Food is usually safe unless it 
touched floodwater or was not kept 
cold. Throw out food or drink if: 
•  It is likely to spoil; 
•  Has an odd odor, color, or feel; 
•  It touched floodwater and is 
not in a waterproof package;  
•  It has a screw cap or “pop top” 
•  Its can is rusted, swollen, 
leaking or badly creased or 
dented. 

 
Cans that aren’t damaged may be 
saved. First: 
•  Take label off; 
•  Wash with soap and clean 
water;  
•  Sanitize with a mix of  
one tablespoon bleach in 
one gallon of safe water;  
•  Write the product name and 
expiration date on the can. 
When in doubt, throw it out! 
 
Keep cold foods cold 
Throw out refrigerated or frozen food 
if it has been: 
•  Above 41° F for 4 hours or more; 
      or 
•  Thawed for 2 hours or more. 
Note: MDH has detailed 
fact sheets on these 
topics. See page 2. 

 
 

 
 
 
 
 

  

If you lose power, a refrigerator will 
keep food cool for 4-6 hours if you 
keep it closed. Food will stay frozen 
for one day in a freezer that is half-
full and kept closed; or up to 2 days if it 
is full.  
 
Use safe water  
Only use safe water for drinking, 
cooking, making ice or baby formula, 
washing hands and dishes. If your 
water well has been flooded, water is 
most likely not safe.   
 
 
Clean hands and surfaces  
Clean all hard surfaces such as 
countertops, sinks, dishes, utensils 
and other items that hold food. 
 
Do all five steps to clean surfaces: 
1.  Use soap and warm, safe 
water; 
2.  Rinse with safe water; 
3.  Soak 1 minute with a mix of 1 
Tablespoon household bleach 
per gallon of safe water; 
4.  W ipe countertops and soak 
dishes and utensils with this 
bleach mix; 
5.  Allow to air dry.  

 
Before touching food, wash 
hands well. Scrub hands with 
soap and safe water.
