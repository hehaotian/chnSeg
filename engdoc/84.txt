to having sex.

You could get

a sexually

transmitted

disease (STD).

Here’s what you

should know.

HIV/STD
Know the Facts
and Protect Yourself

from having contact with someone’s
body fluids, which include:
왘 Blood
왘 Semen
왘 Woman’s body fluids
왘 Mothers can also transfer the
disease to their baby through
their breast milk
Have safer sex. “Safer sex” means
sex with someone who has been tested
and is not having risky sex with other
partners. Your partner may not know
if they have HIV, because someone
with HIV may not have symptoms.
If you aren’t sure, use a condom.
Don’t forget— it can break.
HIV is also spread through the use of
needles. If you inject drugs, use a new
needle each time. Never share.
Having sex is not worth getting sick
or losing your life. The only way to
know if you have HIV is to get tested.
Know the facts. Don’t take risks,
and get tested.

WHAT ARE STDS?
An STD is a disease that you can
get from having sex or from body
fluids. STDs can cause major
health problems.
HOW TO PREVENT STDS
Do not have sex with someone who
has an STD. Avoid contact with their
body fluids and open sores. If your
partner does not know if they have
an STD, use a condom. Be careful —
it can break.
WHY SHOULD
I GET SCREENED?
Some STDs do not have symptoms.
That is why you need to get screened
if you are having sex. This way
you can receive treatment and will
not spread the disease. You can
also protect your baby if you are
pregnant. Mothers with STDs have
a high chance of giving the disease
to their unborn baby.
A Pap smear test detects cancer of
the cervix. It is not a test for STDs.
WHAT IS HIV?
HIV is the virus that causes the
STD called AIDS. There is no cure,
but treatment can help a patient
feel better and live longer.
HOW TO
PREVENT HIV
You cannot get HIV from water
fountains or toilets. You can get HIV
