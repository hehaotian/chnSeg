Immunizations 
(Shots) Keep Your Child Healthy 
What Are Immunizations? 
Immunizations help keep your baby or child from getting sick. Most 
immunizations are given as shots, but some, such as rotavirus, are 
given by mouth. They work by helping the body fight illness. In most 
cases, the shots will prevent your child from getting serious diseases. 
If your child does get sick, it will most likely be a much milder case.  

When Should My Child Get Shots? 
It is important for your child to get shots at the right time. That’s 
why your child needs to see a doctor for well-care visits. Follow the 
schedule your doctor gives you. Bring your immunization record 
(yellow card) with you.

Are Shots Safe?  
Yes. Lots of children get shots each year. Years of testing are needed 
before a vaccine (immunization) can be approved and used. Shots 
may sometimes cause mild side effects. The most common is soreness 
or redness where the shot is given. A low-grade fever can sometimes 
occur. Anything more serious is rare. Call your doctor if you have 
concerns about how your child feels after getting shots.

Do Shots Cause Autism?  
No. Autism is a developmental disorder. Studies show that shots do 
not cause autism. Autism rates are the same in children who get shots 
as in those who don’t. Some people think there is a link between 
thimerosal (a mercury-based preservative used in some vaccines) and 
autism. Although this has never been proven, thimerosal has been 
removed from all routinely given childhood vaccines in the United 
States.
