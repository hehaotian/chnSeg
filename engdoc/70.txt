Handwashing 
Scrub hands often with soap and 
water. Then use alcohol-based hand 
sanitizer if it is available. Wash hands: 
 
•  Before touching food or your face; 
•  After using a toilet; 
•  After touching items touched by 
flood water or sewage; 
•  After flood cleanup; and 
•  Dry off with paper towels if you 
have them, then throw towels out. 

Clean Surfaces that Hold Food 
Do all four steps to clean surfaces: 
 
1.  Use soap and warm, safe water; 
2.  Rinse with safe water; 
3.  Soak one minute with a mix of       
one tablespoon household 
chlorine bleach in one gallon of 
safe water; 
4.  Allow to air dry. 

 
Food Safety 
Do not eat – throw out – food that may 
be unsafe: 
 
•  Food likely to spoil; 
•  Food and containers of food and 
drink that may have been in 
contact with flood water, including 
unopened cans and bottles with 
screw caps and “pop tops;” and 
•  Food with an odd odor, color, or 
feel. 

 
 
When in doubt, throw it out!

Drinking Water  
If your water well has been flooded, it 
is most likely not safe to drink. 
 
Use only water from a known, safe 
source for drinking, cooking, making 
ice or baby formula, dishwashing, or 
brushing teeth. 
 
The safest water choices at this time 
are bottles of water you buy at a store 
or water boiled at a rolling boil for at 
least one minute.  Local officials may 
have more information. 
 
Use caution if you use flooded well 
water for bathing. Showering is not 
advised. 
 
Gasoline Powered Engines 
Gasoline engines are used to pump 
water or make power. Always use 
them outside -- never indoors.  
 
Use gasoline engines away from 
enclosed spaces. Do not use in 
garages, open windows, doors, vents, 
or air intakes. 
 
These engines make poisonous gases 
like carbon monoxide. This deadly gas 
has no odor, color or taste. It can 
cause illness or death.
