Get Tested for HIV
Reduce risky behaviors and use condoms 
to protect yourself and others.

• More than 100,000 New Yorkers are  living with HIV.

• As many as 1  in 4 don’t know they’re  infected.

• There  is still no vaccine, and still no cure.

• Thanks to new medications 
and early treatment, people 
with HIV are feeling better 
and  living  longer – holding 
jobs, raising families,
doing well.

• Available  in Spanish, Chinese,
and other  languages: call 311 
or visit nyc.gov/health

• Disponible en español: llame

Know Your HIV Status – Get Tested 
If you have ever been sexually active, or ever injected drugs 
(even if only once), you should be tested for HIV.

• Rapid tests are now available that 
give results  in  less than an hour.

• If you’re  infected, you can get 
medical  treatment  to  feel better
and live longer. You can also prevent
others from becoming  infected.

• If you’re pregnant or planning 
pregnancy, knowing your HIV
status can save your baby’s  life.

Protect Yourself and Others 
Not having sex and not shooting drugs are the only ways 
to be sure you won’t get infected with HIV.

• If you are sexually active, you can reduce your risk of getting 
or spreading HIV by having sex only  in a mutually monogamous 
relationship with a partner you are sure  is not  infected.

• If you have sex outside of such a relationship, take these steps 
to reduce your risk of getting or spreading HIV;

• Always use a  latex condom whenever 
you have sex – vaginal, anal, or oral.

• Limit  the number of people you
have sex with. The more people,
the higher your risk. Sex with 
people you do not know 
also  increases your risk.

• Avoid alcohol and other 
drugs when you have 
sex. Being high makes  it   
much harder to remember 
to use condoms.

• If you  inject drugs,
never share needles.
Use a new, sterile 
needle and “works”
every time. For 
information 
and help,
call 311.

B.Y.O.C. (Bring Your Own
Condom) 
Latex condoms protect against HIV 
and many other sexually transmitted
diseases (STDs).

• Use  latex condoms.

• Condoms made of “natural”
materials  like  lambskin prevent
pregnancy, but don’t protect against
HIV and other STDs.

• If you are allergic to  latex, use 
condoms made of polyurethane 
or other synthetic materials.

• Female condoms, which are 
placed  in the vagina, are made of polyurethane
and also protect against HIV.

If You Have HIV, It’s Important to Know 
If you have HIV and you know it, you can take better care 
of your health:

• You can get medical treatment for HIV to feel better and  live  longer.

• And you can do other things to stay healthy, for example:

• Get  immunized against flu and pneumonia.

• Quit smoking. For help, call 311 and ask for the Smokers’ Quitline.

• Get help for alcohol and drug problems. Talk to your doctor, call 
1-800-LifeNet (1-800-543-3638), or call 311 and ask for LifeNet.

Do ask, and do tell! If you have HIV:

• Talk to anyone you have had sex with so they can get testing and 
counseling, too. If you need help notifying your partners, talk to 
your doctor or call 311 and ask for CNAP (see More Information).

• Tell anyone you are thinking of having sex with that you’re HIV-
positive before you have sex (even  if they don’t ask!).

• Never have sex without a  latex condom. Even  if you’re on anti-HIV
medications and even  if your viral  load  is not detectable, you can 
still transmit HIV. Using a condom can:

• Prevent you from becoming  infected with other STDs or 
different strains of HIV that may be more virulent or resistant 
to drug treatment.

• Prevent you from  infecting the person you are having sex with.

• Never share needles or “works.”

Some Activities Are Riskier Than Others 
According to the best available evidence:

• Sharing needles  is very  likely to transmit HIV.

• Receptive anal intercourse  is the riskiest sexual act – 5 times riskier 
than  receptive vaginal  intercourse and 50  times  riskier  than 
receptive oral sex.

• Insertive anal or vaginal  intercourse is 10 times riskier than  insertive 
oral sex.

• Oral sex carries some risk for both partners, but  is  less risky than 
other penetrative sexual activities.

• Condoms greatly reduce the spread of HIV for both partners  in 
anal, vaginal, and oral sex.

Everyday Activities Do Not Spread HIV
• HIV  is spread by  injecting drugs, through sexual activity, or from 
a mother to her baby during pregnancy or breast-feeding.

• You can’t get HIV from other activities, such as donating blood,
shaking hands, sharing dishes, using public toilets, playing sports,
or kissing.

Where to Get Tested 
• You can get an HIV test from your doctor or medical group.

• Many community-based organization offer HIV tests.

• Free testing  is available at public health clinics  in all 5 boroughs 
(see More Information).

• People younger than 18 years do not need parental consent for 
counseling, testing, or treatment.

• For more  information about HIV and other STDs, including 
where to get  free, confidential, or anonymous counseling and 
testing, call 311 or visit nyc.gov/health/std

Get Tested for HIV
Reduce risky behaviors and use condoms 
to protect yourself and others.

• More than 100,000 New Yorkers are  living with HIV.

• As many as 1  in 4 don’t know they’re  infected.

• There  is still no vaccine, and still no cure.

• Thanks to new medications 
and early treatment, people 
with HIV are feeling better 
and  living  longer – holding 
jobs, raising families,
doing well.

• Available  in Spanish, Chinese,
and other  languages: call 311 
or visit nyc.gov/health
