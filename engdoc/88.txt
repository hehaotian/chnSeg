SMOKING
It’s Time to Quit

HOW TO QUIT SMOKING
Set a quit date, and start to cut back
before the date.
Don’t try to do it alone. See your doctor
for help and tell friends and loved
ones what you’re doing. They can help.
Avoid smokers while you are quitting.
Know what to expect. The first few
weeks of quitting can be rough, but
there’s good news too. While you may
have a bad temper and trouble sleeping
at first, it will stop after about three
weeks.

It may look hard now, but you can
quit. It may take you more than one
try to do it. Now is the time to quit.

those you love.

YOUR SMOKE
HARMS OTHERS
Your smoke can cause disease in
others. Children can get asthma and
other lung diseases. It can give friends
and family heart disease and lung
cancer as if they smoked.
If you are pregnant, or thinking about
becoming pregnant, get help and quit
smoking now. The smoke you inhale
can cause your baby to be born early
or with a low birth weight. It can even
cause your baby to die in the womb.
After birth, breathing smoke can
cause a baby to die all of a sudden.
This is called Sudden Infant
Death Syndrome (SIDS).
