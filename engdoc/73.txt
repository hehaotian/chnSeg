   Plague


   Plague

What is Plague and How do People get it?


   Plague disease is a severe illness that can result in pneumonia,
   swollen glands, blood infection, and death. It is caused by bacteria
   named Yersinia pestis.


   Plague killed millions in the 14th century and was called the Black
   Death. In 1900, there was an outbreak of plague in San Francisco
   caused by infected rats brought by a ship. Plague is mainly a disease
   of rodents and is most common in the southwestern United States,
   particularly Arizona and New Mexico. Naturally occurring plague causes
   an average of 5 to 15 human cases each year in the western United
   States. From 1994-2006, eight cases of plague were reported in
   California; none of these cases were in San Francisco.


   People can touch or breathe in plague bacteria or get it from the bite
   of an infected flea. This is called exposure to plague. Not everybody
   who is exposed to plague will get sick. But many will, and as the
   plague bacteria multiply inside the body, they can cause serious
   illness.


   Someone can get exposed to naturally-occurring plague by:
     * Getting bitten by a plague-infected flea.
     * Touching the fluid draining from the swollen gland of an
       untreated, plague-infected person.
     * Breathing in small drops that come from the coughs, sneezes or
       spit of people or animals with the lung form of plague
       (pneumonia).
     * Touching the body of an animal that died from plague.

   Terrorists could use plague bacteria to hurt people on purpose by
   releasing the bacteria in public places.


What if there is a Plague Emergency in San Francisco?

   The San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH) has a plan to
   respond quickly to a plague emergency. SFDPH will evaluate the plague
   situation and may recommend ways for people to keep themselves and
   their family safe. Recommendations may include antibiotics for people
   who are at risk of illness. SFDPH will also participate in efforts to
   provide needed medical support and treatment, and to reduce any
   ongoing sources of plague bacteria.


How can I keep from Getting Plague?

   To lower your risk of getting plague from a natural source:
     * Do not handle sick or dead animal bodies. But if you must, then
       use gloves plus face and eye protection.
     * Avoid rodents (mice, rats) and rodent droppings.
     * Avoid insect bites by using an insect repellent containing DEET.
     * Eliminate fleas from your home.
     * Avoid touching infected tissues, materials, or body fluids from a
       plague-infected person or animal.
     * Keep a minimum of 3 feet between you and anyone who may have the
       lung form of plague (pneumonia).
     * It is always a good idea to wash your hands regularly and avoid
       touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.

   If terrorists release plague bacteria on purpose, check for
   recommendations from SFDPH.


Is there a Medicine to Prevent Plague disease?

   Yes. If you have been exposed to plague, there are certain antibiotics
   you can take before you get sick as a way to prevent illness. These
   antibiotics can prevent plague disease even after the plague bacteria
   have already gotten into your body. They work best when you start
   taking them as soon as possible after plague exposure. In an emergency
   involving plague, SFDPH will announce which antibiotics to take, who
   should take them, how and where you can get them, and how to take them
   after exposure to plague.


Is there a Vaccine (shot) to Prevent Plague?

   No, there is no vaccine for plague available now in the United States.


Can I catch Plague from Someone?

   Yes. Plague is contagious (spread from person-to-person). You should
   keep a minimum of 3 feet between you and anyone who may have the lung
   form of plague, or who is coughing, sneezing, has a fever, or is short
   of breath. You should avoid touching infected tissues or body fluids
   from a plague-infected person or animal. You should also wash your
   hands often and avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.


What are the Signs of Plague disease?

     * Lung (pneumonic) Plague is the most likely form of disease after
       an intentional release of plague and occurs by breathing in the
       plague bacteria. After exposure, it usually takes 1-4 days
       (sometimes up to 6 days) until illness starts. It may start with
       symptoms that seem like the common flu - fever, headache, cough,
       vomiting, and muscle aches - but will then progress quickly to
       pneumonia, with severe coughing, shortness of breath, and chest
       pain.
     * Bubonic Plague is the most common naturally-occurring form of
       plague and is caused by the bite of an infected flea. A sore
       usually forms at the site of the bite. Plague bacteria enter the
       skin and travel to the nearest lymph node (gland), usually in the
       groin, underarm, or neck. The lymph node becomes red, swollen, and
       painful, and can leak infected fluid. This swollen, draining lymph
       node is called a "bubo."
     * Septicemic (blood) Plague is a blood infection with plague
       bacteria. It can result from fleabites, touching plague-infected
       materials with broken skin, or spread of infection from the lung
       or bubo. Once plague bacteria are in the bloodstream, severe
       illness and death can follow quickly. Very rarely, humans develop
       plague meningitis (brain infection) or pharyngitis (throat
       infection).

   See a doctor right away if you are having the signs listed above and
   you think you may have been exposed to plague. It is important to
   start medical treatment as soon as possible.


Is there Treatment for Plague disease?

   Yes. All forms of plague can be treated with the proper antibiotics.
   Plague can be deadly however if no antibiotics are taken or if the
   antibiotics are taken too late.


How can I find Information during a Plague Emergency?

   Check the SFDPH website [107]www.sfdph.org/cdcp. Local media such as
   newspapers, TV stations and radio will carry emergency instructions.
   Emergency radio stations include: KCBS 740 AM and KGO 810 AM.


What can I do now if I am worried about plague?

     * Read about plague at [108]www.sfdph.org/cdcp and at the CDC page
       [109]www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/plague
     * Go to [110]www.72hours.org to learn about steps you can take now
       to prepare for all disasters.
     * Keep a card in your wallet with a list of your health problems,
       the names and doses of medicines you take, and any medicines you
       are allergic to.
