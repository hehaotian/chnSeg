HIGH BLOOD
PRESSURE
What You Need to Know
About the “Silent Killer”

PREVENTION
AND TREATMENT
You can delay or lower high blood
pressure by changing your health habits:
왘 Eat healthy
왘 Adults should exercise at least two
and a half hours each week and
work out their muscles at least
twice a week
왘 Kids should exercise at least one
hour each day
왘 Keep your weight at a healthy level
왘 Don’t smoke
왘 Learn to cope with stress
Sometimes doing these things is enough.
Often, you will also need to take one,
two or more kinds of pills. High blood
pressure is a lifetime condition. You
can control it, but it will not go away.
See your doctor for regular check-ups
to keep your blood pressure at healthy
levels.
You can control your blood pressure
so it does not control you.

High blood

pressure is often

called the silent

killer. You can’t

feel or see it,

but it has a big

effect on your

body. Get checked

regularly. Learn

how to control it.

WHAT IS HIGH
BLOOD PRESSURE?
Your heart pumps blood to all parts
of your body. Blood travels through
pathways in our body. The blood
pushes on the walls of these pathways.
If the blood pushes too hard it can
cause high blood pressure and damage
your body. High blood pressure puts
you at higher risk for heart problems,
stroke and kidney problems.
About one in three people who have
high blood pressure don’t know they
have it. That is why it is important
to have your blood pressure checked
regularly. High blood pressure can
be treated.
Your blood pressure is shown by two
numbers. The first number measures
the force of blood while the heart is
pumping. This is also called systolic
blood pressure. The second number
measures the force between beats. This
is called diastolic blood pressure. For
normal blood pressure, the first number
should be less than 120. The second
number should be less than 80.
WHO GETS HIGH
BLOOD PRESSURE?
High blood pressure is the most
common heart health problem.
It gets more common as you get
older. More men have it than women.
You are more likely to get it if you
are overweight or if someone else in
your family has it.
